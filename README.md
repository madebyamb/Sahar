# Beyrouth

This is a very basic website where I show and explain the different steps me and my team went through to make it a reality.

We created a video after a documentary of Charles Villa for BRUT magazine named "Le destin de Sahar".

Our intention was to reach new people with this video through subtitles in both english and Lebanon.

Hope you enjoy the show :)
